## Installation

In order to install clone the git repository, then run an npm install. Then to set up the database go into mysql and type in source schema.sql or whatever the file path is to schema.sql, like db/schema.sql if you are in the root directory of the project. From there you need to create a .env file with the DB_NAME set to ecommerce_db, the DB_USER set to your mysql user, in my case root, and the DB_PW set to the user's password. From there we can now seed the db by running 'npm run seed' which will create the tables and some defualt entries into the db. Finally we can now run the code at any time by running npm start.
